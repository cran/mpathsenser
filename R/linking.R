#' Link y to the time scale of x
#'
#' @description `r lifecycle::badge("stable")`
#'
#'   One of the key tasks in analysing mobile sensing data is being able to link it to other data.
#'   For example, when analysing physical activity data, it could be of interest to know how much
#'   time a participant spent exercising before or after an ESM beep to evaluate their stress level.
#'   [link()] allows you to map two data frames to each other that are on different time scales,
#'   based on a pre-specified offset before and/or after. This function assumes that both `x` and
#'   `y` have a column called `time` containing \link[base]{DateTimeClasses}.
#'
#' @details `y` is matched to the time scale of `x` by means of time windows. These time windows are
#'   defined as the period between `x - offset_before` and `x + offset_after`. Note that either
#'   `offset_before` or `offset_after` can be 0, but not both. The "interval" of the measurements is
#'   therefore the associated time window for each measurement of `x` and the data of `y` that also
#'   falls within this period. For example, an `offset_before`  of
#'   \code{\link[lubridate]{minutes}(30)} means to match all data of `y` that occurred *before* each
#'   measurement in `x`. An `offset_after` of 900 (i.e. 15 minutes) means to match all data of `y`
#'   that occurred *after* each measurement in `x`. When both `offset_before` and `offset_after` are
#'   specified, it means all data of `y` is matched in an interval of 30 minutes before and 15
#'   minutes after each measurement of `x`, thus combining the two arguments.
#'
#'   The arguments `add_before` and `add_after` let you decide whether you want to add the last
#'   measurement before the interval and/or the first measurement after the interval respectively.
#'   This could be useful when you want to know which type of event occurred right before or after
#'   the interval of the measurement. For example, at `offset_before = "30 minutes"`, the data may
#'   indicate that a participant was running 20 minutes before a measurement in `x`, However, with
#'   just that information there is no way of knowing what the participant was doing the first 10
#'   minutes of the interval. The same principle applies to after the interval. When `add_before` is
#'   set to `TRUE`, the last measurement of `y` occurring before the interval of `x` is added to the
#'   output data as the first row, having the **`time` of \code{x - offset_before}** (i.e. the start
#'   of the interval). When `add_after` is set to `TRUE`, the first measurement of `y` occurring
#'   after the interval of `x` is added to the output data as the last row, having the **`time` of
#'   `x + offset_after`** (i.e. the end of the interval). This way, it is easier to calculate the
#'   difference to other measurements of `y` later (within the same interval). Additionally, an
#'   extra column (`original_time`) is added in the nested `data` column, which is the original time
#'   of the `y` measurement and `NULL` for every other observation. This may be useful to check if
#'   the added measurement isn't too distant (in time) from the others. Note that multiple rows may
#'   be added if there were multiple measurements in `y` at exactly the same time. Also, if there
#'   already is a row with a timestamp exactly equal to the start of the interval (for `add_before =
#'   TRUE`) or to the end of the interval `(add_after = TRUE`), no extra row is added.
#'
#' @section Warning: Note that setting `add_before` and `add_after` each add one row to each nested
#'   \code{tibble} of the `data` column. Thus, if you are only interested in the total count (e.g.
#'   the number of total screen changes), remember to set these arguments to FALSE or make sure to
#'   filter out rows that do _not_ have an `original_time`. Simply subtracting 1 or 2 does not work
#'   as not all measurements in `x` may have a measurement in `y` before or after (and thus no row
#'   is added).
#'
#'
#' @param x,y A pair of data frames or data frame extensions (e.g. a tibble). Both `x` and `y` must
#'   have a column called `time`.
#' @param by A character vector indicating the variable(s) to match by, typically the participant
#'   IDs. If NULL, the default, `*_join()` will perform a natural join, using all variables in
#'   common across `x` and `y`. Therefore, all data will be mapped to each other based on the time
#'   stamps of `x` and `y`. A message lists the variables so that you can check they're correct;
#'   suppress the message by supplying by explicitly.
#'
#'   To join by different variables on `x` and `y`, use a named vector. For example, `by = c('a' =
#'   'b')` will match `x$a` to `y$b`.
#'
#'   To join by multiple variables, use a vector with `length > 1`. For example, `by = c('a', 'b')`
#'   will match `x$a` to `y$a` and `x$b` to `y$b`. Use a named vector to match different variables
#'   in `x` and `y`. For example, `by = c('a' = 'b', 'c' = 'd')` will match `x$a` to `y$b` and `x$c`
#'   to `y$d`.
#'
#'   To perform a cross-join (when `x` and `y` have no variables in common), use `by = character()`.
#'   Note that the `split` argument will then be set to 1.
#' @param time The name of the column containing the timestamps in `x`.
#' @param end_time Optionally, the name of the column containing the end time in `x`. If specified,
#'   it means `time` defines the start time of the interval and `end_time` the end time. Note that
#'   this cannot be used at the same time as `offset_before` or `offset_after`.
#' @param y_time The name of the column containing the timestamps in `y`.
#' @param offset_before The time before each measurement in `x` that denotes the period in which `y`
#'   is matched. Must be convertible to a period by [lubridate::as.period()].
#' @param offset_after The time after each measurement in `x` that denotes the period in which `y`
#'   is matched. Must be convertible to a period by [lubridate::as.period()].
#' @param add_before Logical value. Do you want to add the last measurement before the start of each
#'   interval?
#' @param add_after Logical value. Do you want to add the first measurement after the end of each
#'   interval?
#' @param name The name of the column containing the nested `y` data.
#' @param split An optional grouping variable to split the computation by. When working with large
#'   data sets, the computation can grow so large it no longer fits in your computer's working
#'   memory (after which it will probably fall back on the swap file, which is very slow). Splitting
#'   the computation trades some computational efficiency for a large decrease in RAM usage. This
#'   argument defaults to `by` to automatically suppress some of its RAM usage.
#'
#' @returns A tibble with the data of `x` with a new column `data` with the matched data of `y`
#'   according to `offset_before` and `offset_after`.

#' Link gaps to (ESM) data
#'
#' @description `r lifecycle::badge("stable")`
#'
#'   Gaps in mobile sensing data typically occur when the app is stopped by the operating system or
#'   the user. While small gaps may not pose problems with analyses, greater gaps may cause bias or
#'   skew your data. As a result, gap data should be considered in order to inspect and limit their
#'   influence. This function, analogous to [link()], allows you to connect gaps to other data
#'   (usually ESM/EMA data) within a user-specified time range.
#'
#' @param data A data frame or an extension to a data frame (e.g. a tibble). While gap data can be
#'   linked to any other type of data, ESM data is most commonly used.
#' @param gaps A data frame (extension) containing the gap data. See [identify_gaps()] for
#'   retrieving gap data from an mpathsenser database. It should at least contain the columns `from`
#'   and `to` (both in a date-time format), as well as any specified columns in `by`.
#' @inheritParams link
#' @param raw_data Whether to include the raw data (i.e. the matched gap data) to the output as
#'   gap_data.
#'
#' @seealso [bin_data()] for linking two sets of intervals to each other; [identify_gaps()] for
#'   finding gaps in the sampling; [add_gaps()] for adding gaps to sensor data;
#'
#' @returns The original `data` with an extra column `duration` indicating the gap during within the
#'   interval in seconds (if `duration`  is `TRUE`), or an extra column called `gap_data` containing
#'   the gaps within the interval. The function ensures all durations and gap time stamps are within
#'   the range of the interval.

#' Create bins in variable time series

#' difficult when two subsequent measurements are in different bins or span over multiple bins.
#'
#' @param data A data frame or tibble containing the time series.
#' @param start_time The column name of the start time of the interval, a POSIXt.
#' @param end_time The column name of the end time of the interval, a POSIXt.
#' @param by A binning specification.
#' @param fixed Whether to create fixed bins. If `TRUE`, bins will be rounded to, for example,
