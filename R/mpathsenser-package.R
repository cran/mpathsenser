#' Overcomes one of the major challenges in mobile (passive) sensing, namely
#' being able to pre-process the raw data that comes from a mobile sensing app,
#' specifically "m-Path Sense" <https://m-path.io>. The main task of 'mpathsenser' is
#' therefore to read "m-Path Sense" JSON files into a database and provide several
#' convenience functions to aid in data processing.
