# How to get started

## Installing the package
To install this package, make sure you have [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (Windows, Linux) or XCode installed. For XCode, register as an [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/register/agree/) (don't worry, it's free) and then run `xcode-select --install` in a terminal. Then, run the following code in R:

```r
devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.kuleuven.be/ppw-okpiv/researchers/u0134047/mpathsenser")
```

## Importing files

Specify a path variable to wherever you put the JSON files. Make sure to use / and not a backslash.

```r
path <- "~/Mobile Sensing Study/Data"
```

If you haven't done so, unzip all files.

```r
unzip_data(path = path, parallel = TRUE)
```

In m-Path Sense, data is written to JSON files as it comes in. In the JSON file format, every file starts with [ and ends with ]. If the app is killed, JSON files are not properly closed and hence cannot be read by JSON readers. So, we must first test if all files are in a valid JSON format and fix those that are not.

```r
to_fix <- test_jsons(path = path)

# Fix JSON files if there are any
if(to_fix != "") {
	fix_jsons(path = path, files = to_fix, parallel = TRUE)
}
```

If you want to  put the database in a different directory than the files, create it first and then pass it to `import`.

```r
db <- create_db("path/for/you/new/database/", "some_db.db")
``` 

If not, you can simply call `import` to start reading in the files.

```r
import(path = path, dbname = "some_db.db")

# In the case of an existing database or database in another location:
# import(path = path, db = db)
```

Note that `import` always closes the database connection.

## Extracting data from the database
To establish a database connection, use `open_db`. Don't forget to save it to a variable!

```r
db <- open_db(path = path, db_name = "some_db.db")
```

To find out which participants are in the database (or rather their participant numbers):
```r
get_participants(db)
```

We can also check what device they are using (which can be found in the Device table of the database).

```r
device_info(db = db)
```

To find out how much data there is in this database, look at the number of rows as an indication. You may notice from running this function that it's not exactly fast. That's because it is a lot of data. So be careful when computing things, or you'll be stuck for a long time (especially when working with accelerometer and gyroscope)

```r
get_nrows(db)
```

Now let's find out how to actually retrieve data from the database. There is a simple function for this, which is called `get_data`. With this function you can extract any kind of data you want. Make sure you also run `?get_data` for an overview of how to use this (or any other) function. In most functions, you can also leave arguments empty to retrieve all data (e.g. not in a specific time window).

```r
get_data(
	db = db, # the ACTIVE database connection, open with open_db AND save to a variable
	sensor = "Activity", # A sensor name, see mpathsenser::sensors for the full list
	participant_id = "12345", # A participant ID, see get_participants
	start_date = "2021-11-14", # An optional start date, in the format YYYY-MM-DD
	end_date = "2021-11-15" # An optional end date, in the format YYYY-MM-DD
)
```
