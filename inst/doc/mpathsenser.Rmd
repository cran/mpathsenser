```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

First, make sure we load some useful libraries (and of course `mpathsenser` itself).

```{r setup}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(mpathsenser)
```

# Importing files

The data for this vignette is contained in the `extdata` folder. However, on some system this folder may be set to read-only and it is generally good practice not to modify package folders (to prevent changing or breaking the package). To this end, we first copy the data to a temporary directory (as defined by the environment variable \code{TMPDIR}, \code{TMP}, or \code{TEMP}), a directory that is freshly created each time at R's start up and cleaned up when the session ends.

```{r copy data, results="hide"}
# Get the temp folder
tempdir <- tempdir()
tempdir <- file.path(tempdir, "vignette")
dir.create(tempdir)

# Get a handle to the data files
path <- system.file("extdata", "example", package = "mpathsenser")

# Get a list of all the files that are to be copied
copy_list <- list.files(path, "carp-data", full.names = TRUE)

# Copy all data
file.copy(
  from = copy_list,
  to = tempdir,
  overwrite = TRUE,
  copy.mode = FALSE
)
```

The `extdata` folder contains several `.zip` files as well as some `JSON` files. It is likely that the data for your study will look the same only much more. Note that all of these data files came directly from m-Path Sense (i.e. there was no pre-processing yet).

The data from m-Path Sense originates in the following way: The application continuously collects all kinds of data in the background (e.g. accelerometer data). Once collected, the data goes through several stages where, for example, the data is pre-processed (as already happens with data from the `light` sensor) or anonymised upon request. Finally, data is written to a `JSON` file which is really just a text file but with a specific format. When some new data comes in (whether it be from the same sensor or not), the next line is written in the `JSON` file and so on, until the file has reached a certain size (5MB by default). The `JSON` file is then zipped to reduce its size and subsequently transferred to a server. Once transferred, the data is deleted from the participant's phone to both save on space as well as prevent data leakage.

Thus, a first step to take is to unzip these files to extract its `JSON` contents. If you feel more comfortable unzipping using your favourite zip program you can do so, just make sure all files end up in the same directory (including the non-zipped JSON files).

```{r unzip}
unzip_data(path = tempdir)
```

In m-Path Sense, data is written to JSON files as it comes in. In the JSON file format, every file starts with `[` and ends with `]`. If the app is killed, JSON files are not properly closed and hence cannot be read by JSON parsers. So, we must first test if all files are in a valid JSON format and fix those that are not.

While you can also call `fix_jsons()` directly, it is generally safer (and faster) to first run `test_jsons()` to get an idea of how many files need fixing.

```{r fix and test JSONS}
# Note that test_jsons returns the full path names
to_fix <- test_jsons(tempdir)
print(to_fix)

fix_jsons(path = NULL, to_fix)
```

```{r import data}
# Create a new database
db <- create_db(tempdir, "getstarted.db")

# Import the data
import(
  path = tempdir,
  db = db,
  batch_size = 12
)
```

```{r, fig.width=13, fig.height=8, fig.align='center', dpi=55}
sensors <- c(
  "Accelerometer", "Activity", "AppUsage", "Bluetooth", "Calendar",
  "Connectivity", "Device", "Gyroscope", "InstalledApps", "Light",
  "Location", "Memory", "Pedometer", "Screen", "Weather", "Wifi"
)
coverage(
  db = db,
  participant_id = "2784",
  sensor = sensors,
  relative = FALSE
)
```

Finally, recall that once you're done working with a database to also close it.

```{r}
close_db(db)
```
