\arguments{
\item{db}{A valid database connection. Schema must be that as it is created by
\link{open_db}.}

\item{participant_id}{A character string of \emph{one} participant ID.}

\item{sensor}{A character vector containing one or multiple sensors. See
\code{\link[mpathsenser]{sensors}} for a list of available sensors. Use \code{NULL} for all
available sensors.}

\item{frequency}{A named numeric vector with sensors as names and the number of expected samples
per hour}

\item{relative}{Show absolute number of measurements or relative to the expected number?
Logical value.}

\item{offset}{Currently not used.}

\item{start_date}{A date (or convertible to a date using \code{\link[base:as.Date]{base::as.Date()}}) indicating
the earliest date to show. Leave empty for all data. Must be used with \code{end_date}.}

\item{end_date}{A date (or convertible to a date using \code{\link[base:as.Date]{base::as.Date()}}) indicating
the latest date to show.Leave empty for all data. Must be used with \code{start_date}.}

\item{plot}{\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}} Instead of built-in functionality, use
\code{\link[=plot.coverage]{plot.coverage()}} to plot the output.}
}
\value{
A ggplot of the coverage results if \code{plot} is \code{TRUE} or a tibble containing the
hour, type of measure (i.e. sensor), and (relative) coverage.
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable}{\figure{lifecycle-stable.svg}{options: alt='[Stable]'}}}{\strong{[Stable]}}

Only applicable to non-reactive sensors with 'continuous' sampling
