When copying data directly coming from m-Path Sense, JSON files are sometimes corrupted due to
the app not properly closing them. This function attempts to fix the most common
problems associated with improper file closure by m-Path Sense.
}
\details{
There are two distinct problems this functions tries to tackle. First of all, there are often
bad file endings (e.g. no \code{]}) because the app was closed before it could properly close
the file. There are several cases that may be wrong (or even multiple), so it unclear what the
precise problems are. As this function is experimental, it may even make it worse by accidentally
inserting an incorrect file ending.

Secondly, in rare scenarios there are illegal ASCII characters in the JSON files. Not often does
this happen, and it is likely because of an OS failure (such as a flush error), a disk failure,
or corrupted data during transmit. Nevertheless, these illegal characters make the file
completely unreadable. Fortunately, they are detected correctly by
\link[mpathsenser]{test_jsons}, but they cannot be imported by \link[mpathsenser]{import}. This
functions attempts to surgically remove lines with illegal characters, by removing that specific
line as well as the next line, as this is often a comma. It may therefore be too liberal in its
approach -- cutting away more data than necessary -- or not liberal enough when the corruption
has spread throughout multiple lines. Nevertheless, it is a first step in removing some
straightforward corruption from files so that only a small number may still need to be fixed by
hand.

\section{Parallel}{
 This function supports parallel processing in the sense that it is able to
distribute it's computation load among multiple workers. To make use of this functionality, run
\href{https://rdrr.io/cran/future/man/plan.html}{\code{future::plan("multisession")}} before
calling this function.

\section{Progress}{
 You can be updated of the progress of this function by using the
\code{\link[progressr:progress]{progressr::progress()}} package. See \code{progressr}'s
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=progressr/vignettes/progressr-intro.html}{vignette} on
how to subscribe to these updates.
